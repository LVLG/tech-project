Welcome to my tech playground! This is where I try out cool stuff with React, TypeScript, and modern web development tools. Just like our Shiba mascot, this project is curious, playful, and sometimes a bit stubborn (looking at you, TypeScript errors 😅).

> **Note**: This README was co-written with AI, so expect some cringe-worthy attempts at being cute and playful. I mean, who doesn't love emojis everywhere, right? 🙈
